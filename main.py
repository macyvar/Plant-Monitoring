@brief This is the main script that integrates preprocessing, feature extraction,
      spot detection, and machine learning classification for plant disease detection.
      It loads a trained model, processes a given leaf image, extracts features,
      predicts whether the leaf is diseased, and counts visible disease spots.

@usage
   python3 main.py

@dependencies
   - preprocess.py
   - spot_detection.py
   - features.py
   - train_classifier.py
   - model.pkl (pre-trained Random Forest model)
