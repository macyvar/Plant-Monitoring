@file spot_detection.py

@brief Provides functions for detecting diseased spots on leaves using HSV thresholding
      and contour detection with OpenCV.

@function detect_spots
   Identifies spot regions in an HSV image and returns their properties for analysis.

@returns
   Tuple (spot_data, mask) where spot_data includes area and mean color per spot.
