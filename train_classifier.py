@brief This module handles the training and loading of a machine learning model
    for classifying plant leaf health. It uses a Random Forest classifier
    trained on color histogram features extracted from leaf images.

@functions
- train_model(data_folder): Trains a RandomForest model on labeled images and saves it.
- load_model(path): Loads a previously saved model from disk.

@dependencies
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (cv2)
- joblib
- features.py for feature extraction

## Imports
# For file and folder handling (paths, listing files)
import os
# OpenCV â€“ used for reading and processing images
import cv2
# Handles numerical arrays (features)
import numpy as np
# RandomForestClassifier: Your machine learning model
# from scikit-learn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# train_test_split: Splits your dataset into training
# and testing sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# joblib: Saves and loads the trained model
import joblib
# extract_color_features: Your custom function (from
# features.py) to get feature vectors from leaf images
from features import extract_color_features

## Model Loader
# Loads a previously trained model from a .pkl file
# using joblib. Running predictions later using
# main.py without re-training

# X will store the feature vectors extracted from the
# images. y will store the corresponding labels: 0 for
# healthy, 1 for diseased
def train_model(data_folder):
    X = []
    y = []

    # 1 for "diseased". Builds a path like data_folder/healthy or
    # data_folder/diseased

            # histogram features using your custom function,

    # and labels
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

    # Evaluates accuracy on the test set. Saves the trained model to a
    # file (model.pkl) for future use.
